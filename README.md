## Blackjack
This project is a C# Console project replicating the basic rules of BlackJack (not including the options to double down or split). It demonstrates the concepts of abstraction, polymorphism, and inheritance.

## Car Insurance
This project is a MVC Web application which mimics an insurance website. It takes user entries and determines a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that displays all quotes given. 

## Newsletter
This is another MVC Project which was built to utilize Entity Framework 6 and implementing a Database First workflow.
